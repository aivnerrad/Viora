# Viora

## Viora Overview
- Anybody with a question can come to Viora and get an answer. Viora is a website that allows users to create posts related to a certain topic in a 'Did you know?' format, and ask questions about a certain topic or give answers to a specific question.

## How it's made
- Viora uses React for the front-end and UI, and PostgreSQL, Python, and Flask for the back end.

<br/>
- Next, you will be taken to your "Home Page" where you will see a "feed" of "Did you know?" type of posts. From this page, you can comment on a post, or upvote a post. You can also upvote a comment as well.

<br/>
- On the left side of the page, there is a topics list, and my(as in me, Darren Via) personal links. Clicking on a specific topic will take you to that page.

<br/>
- On the topic page of your choosing, you will see a prompt to create a new post. The post will need a title in "Did you know?" format. The post will also need a body. The body should explain the "Did you know?" statement.

<br/>
- Under each post on the topics page, the same comment, and upvote, functionality exists. Creating a comment will require you to login first. Once created, a settings button, represented by 3 dots will appear allowing you the option to edit or delete the comment.

<br/>
- If you click on the pen in the navigation bar, you are routed to a "Questions Page". Here you will be able to ask a new question. The question must have title or main line, and a deeper explaination below it.

<br/>
- In each question asked, there is a button to expand the answers provided. When clicked, if the question was not asked by you, an input area will appear allowing you to answer the question yourself. Each answer can be upvoted allowing a user to see which answer was most liked.
